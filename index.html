            <h1>What is Git and GitHub ?</h1>
            <br><br>
            <h1>Let's explain by giving an example;</h1>
            <br>
           <p>Let's say we are working on a website project. 
            Let there be 5 coders and one project manager / team leader working on this project.</p>
            <br>
           <p> Have 1000 lines of code on our index page and make different improvements on these 5 software developers on the index page.
           <br><br>
            Software developer [1] between lines 1 and 200;
            <br>
            Software developer [2] Between line 201 and 401;
            <br>
            Software developer [3] Between 401 and 601;
            <br>
            Software developer [4] Between line 601 and 801;
            <br>
            Software developer [5] between 801 and 1000 lines;
            <br><br>
            Let's think it works. These friends write the codes to the server over ftp.
            <br><br>
            What happens when our 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th software developer send the file to the server, respectively? Of course, the 
            file sent by the 5th developer who sent the file last will crush the file sent by the other 4 developers and will only be the file sent by the 5th developer on the server.
            <br>  <br>
            In addition, what will the team leader / project manager who will control the work of the developers do if he wants to control? 
            <br><br>
            How to take the index file from all the 
            software developers one by one and follow all the additions and subtractions in 1000 lines?
            <br>  <br>
            Even customers abroad, what do you do when you want to see how you are coding in your projects, or where you want to see what plugin you 
            wrote, without installing it in source code systems?
        </p>
        <br>  <br>
            <p>When developing a project, we need to constantly back up our codes.
                 However, if we do not have a very good backup strategy, the backups 
                 will begin to mingle over time. 
                 <br><br><br>
                 Git and GitHub are auxiliary systems
                  for troubleshooting, backup and producing new versions. It takes the
                   backup of the project we created in the warehouse into our place, 
                   saving us from the place, time and turmoil.

                <br><br><br>
                Git is a version-version control system. It is a desktop program. 
                It keeps the changes made in the project together with information
                 such as time, user information, version number.
                 <br><br><br>
                GitHub is a web-based repository. It is a software service that allows 
                to store code stores created with Git under the name of "social coding" 
                in the cloud.
                Unlike other version control systems, Git uses a distributed structure. 
                Thanks to the distributed structure of Git, each coder takes a copy of 
                the project to its own account and the project continues to be developed 
                even in non-internet environments. It is possible to see the changes made 
                by each encoder separately in group works.</p>
